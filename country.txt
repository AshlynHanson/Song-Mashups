I've been looking at you from across the room
'Bout time I've got my nerve
Well you might tell me boy hell naw
But hell it can't hurt
'Cause I just wanna spin you around and around this dancefloor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up stealing a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, baby if you wiling
I'll do my best to change your mind
The way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl it oughta be a crime
Got a pretty good feeling I'm taking you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and
Spin you around and around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up stealing a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, baby if you willing
I'll do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl it oughta be a crime
I've fought in some bars
Broken some hearts
Ain't never done nothing this bad
Yeah, with one look at me
You became my disease
They don't make no cure for that
And I just wanna
Spin you around and around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up stealing a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, baby if you willing
I'll do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart, yeah the way you stole my heart
Yeah the way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl it oughta be a crime
I just wanna spin you around tonight
I just wanna spin you around tonight
The night is getting late, the crowd's headed home
It's just you and me girl on the lake shore
I know I just met you but I can't let you go
Forget about your friends, baby, I'll drive you home (Yeah!)
I'll set you on the tailgate, we'll take it nice and slow
I know it ain't your style, but I won't tell a soul, no
I know you gotta wake up for that 9 to 5
But what's the point of living girl
If you don't feel alive?
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, turn up that song 'bout
Small town lovers, hot summer night
Midnight dancing in the headlights
Some day we might regret leaving that love out by the lake
If you're getting tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
But we can sleep when we're dead
Put your pretty arms around me, now get in nice and close
Whisper in my ear what you'd like to know
Now you can tell me bout your family or tell me bout your day
Or our lips can do the talking, let's listen baby what do you say
I know it's kinda crazy for a Tuesday night
But sometimes a good thing don't need time
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, turn up that song 'bout
Small town lovers, hot summer night
Midnight dancing in the headlights
Some day we might regret leaving that love out by the lake
If you're getting tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
With a smile she pulled me to water
Them southern girls, man, they just don't get any hotter
I said, "No girl, got on my good jeans"
She looked at me boy like "What do you mean?"
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Jump on in, let's have a little fun
Small town lovers, hot summer nights
Out here swimming in the moonlight
Some day we might regret leaving this love out by the lake
But no matter what you do, don't forget what we said
We can sleep when we're dead
We can sleep when we're dead, aw yeah
We can sleep when we're dead
I've made my share
Of empty promises
Not like you care
Anymore
I wish you did
But I've done all I can do
Baby I ain't gonna chase you out that door
If you don't know by now
That you're the one I love
Clearly we were never meant to be
If you'll take the words
Out of someone else's mouth before you take mine
Well I got nothing left to say
Oh, I stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
That I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standing alone
Just the other day
Driving down the highway
Seen a Chevrolet, reminded me of you
I almost called
But I'm sure glad I didn't
I just shook it off and drank some mountain dew
You always said
That it was bad for my health
Well baby you can go to hell
While I stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
That I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standing alone
The waves will crash
And the winds will blow
But I'll be here standing on
My tip toes
Oh, I stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
That I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standing alone
I'm standing alone
I'm standing alone
Standing alone
There's some days when I wake up can't remember where I am
Said some things, regrets some things but I really don't give a damn
Somewhere on this road I'm on I forgot what it's like to feel
I know I can't see heaven up there but I know that it's real
And I ain't sure if I'll get in
But you best believe I'm trying
And it's just what my daddy told me
And that's how I live my life
Gotta take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, nohow
Gotta make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
(Yeah, that's what he did)
I can't heal the broken hearts I left so far behind
But on this road that I haven chose I lost all sense of time
So I drift into the night trying to drown away my sorrows
It might be wrong but that's alright 'cause all the time is borrowed anyways
Gotta take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, nohow
Gotta make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
Some call me lost, some call me crazy
But that's okay
Think what you want, say what you will
But I've always kept it real
There's a cost for all these sins
And I'm bound to pay the price
But this is what my daddy told me
And that's how I live my life
Gotta take that ball cap off, son, before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, nohow
Gotta make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
A man of the south
Better take that ball cap off, son
She's my Yin Yang girl, she's day, she's night
She's the shot in the dark, she's the beam of light
She's a hard contradiction, my brand new addiction
I can sip that wine when I take her out fishing
She's the last one there when they close the bar
Got mud on the tires of a fancy car
She's a real good girl till she's had a few
Likes Church on Sunday, sits in the back pew
Hey, if the preacher only knew
That, man, she's angel who can raise a little hell
A drive-fast high-class southern belle
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rockstar dancing on a tailgate
A little bit a sinner and a little bit a saint
She's my Yin Yang girl, yeah, she's an angel
Who can raise a little hell
She's a daddy's little girl, she can do no wrong
Better hope he never sees her camera phone
She's a real home maker, a whiskey shot taker
A bed time story and a midnight shaker
Shake it baby
And, man, she's angel who can raise a little hell
A drive-fast high-class southern belle
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rockstar dancing on a tailgate
A little bit a sinner and a little bit a saint
She's my Yin Yang girl, yeah, she's an angel
Who can raise a little hell
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive-fast high-class southern belle
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rockstar dancing on a tailgate
A little bit a sinner and a little bit a saint
She's my Yin Yang girl, man, she's an angel
Who can raise a little hell
She's a rockstar dancing on a tailgate
A little bit a Skynard and a little bit a Hank
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's my Yin Yang girl
Who can raise a little hell
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, "Yessir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk
I think I'm past the point of calling you a bad habit
Ain't trying to get no sympathy, or, sound tragic
But it's hard for me to hide your side effects from showing
You strike the match and I burn till I'm just, embers glowing
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
I got a couple hit or miss tricks that I use for distraction
But as soon as I slow down and I start flash-backing
To the night before when I was buzzing harder than that storefront neon
Yeah, if your kiss gets me this high, why wouldn't I just keep on
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Need a little rush from your touch
Little late night pick me up
When you make me come unwound
Why I can't put you down
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain smokin' you
No, no, no, no

It don't matter if we're out under New York lights
Or taking in the scene on Ocean Drive
Or standing underneath that Hollywood sign
In California
I always seem to miss it all
I can't focus, I get lost
And I think you know it's all your fault
Now baby, don't ya?
You ain't no blend in baby

Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm hooked
Girl you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in a crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (in your own league, so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, you're so far from basic)
I wanna find a club and show you off
When we roll in it won't take long
Every guy with a girl, yeah, they gonna get caught
Looking
And I can't blame 'em
And girl you look famous
If I was in their shoes
I'd do the same, 'cause...
You ain't no blend in baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm hooked

Blue ribbon bottles, big block throttles
Marlboros if you want 'em
Go on and take a drag
A little small town freedom
A little taste of dreamin'
No need to preach
No need to shout we believe in
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
Faded Levi's, worn out Chucks
20 in my pocket, feels like a million bucks
Blue-eyed beauty, lean in to me
Our own show in the back row
Miss the whole damn movie
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the morning don't come
These colors don't run
Stay up and stay young
American nights
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the morning don't come
Stay up and stay young
Was Friday after five, I got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than Cain
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, get hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here
Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here
Looking back, I see a million little things things that wrecked us
She never liked my pickup truck parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khakis like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans, old school ring
And she packed up her Chanel, said "go to hell", taught me a lesson
And now as far as she's concerned I'm in a deep and dark depression
But it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of coolers
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy Waylon hooked me up with some Willie
Girl I know a break up ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy hours is done, yeah
And I know she'd hear about my "paint the town red" gallivanting
And she'll think I thought of her curves when I found that gal to dance with
And she'll tell her friends I'm faking my heartbreak
And time will take away my grin
But not when every bar I stumble in...
Is happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of coolers
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy Waylon hooked me up with some Willie
Girl I know a break up ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy hours is done, yeah
Will it make her feel much better if she thinks my life is hell
So tell her ever since she left me it's like time is standing still
And it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of coolers
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy Waylon hooked me up with some Willie
Girl I know a break up ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy hours is done
Yeah, I'm here at happy hour, happy hours is done, yeah
You were talking trash, we were tossing bags
When I caught your name at a cornhole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
Up on top of G10 parking lot
Said, "Girl, where you sitting
I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singing every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You'd have thought that post-game kiss
Woulda made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
They sent out the pride of a south land band
And all I could think about was holding your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have payed anything to see that
16 home team jersey on
Singing every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You'd thought that post-game kiss
Woulda made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
Now every time the leaves start falling down
I get to thinking bout
That 16 home team jersey on
Singing every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You'd thought that post-game kiss
Woulda made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
Watcha know about thumping skeeters with your fingers
With a stringer full of keepers under thunderhead clouds?
Whatcha know about picking off a blackberry?
Little Cherry Skoal Dip make the swelling go down
Mmm girl, lucky for you I'm a two lane tour guide
Mmm get your country boy heartbreaking certified
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back
And you'll be city girl buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that
Yeah whatchu know about that?
Whatchu know about that Saturday summer
Heat deep creek creeping down around a bend
And whatchu know about taking off what you bought at the mall
Hang it all on a sycamore limb
Mmm, we can get on out where the cowboy hats flow
Mmm, whatcha know about a hillbilly backstroke?
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back
And you'll be city girl buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that
Sippin' on shiners, diners, sugar pies
Bobbers and cane poles
Kissing in the fireflies
Bet you gonna smile when you get back home
And that nitty gritty song comes on on your phone
'Cause that's my ring tone, ha
(You and me)
You and me, yeah
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back
And you'll be city girl buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that
Yeah whatchu know about that?
(You and me)
Yeah whatchu know about that?
I'm a simple man, ain't no other way to say it
Lay my cards on the table, only way I play it
I got some draw in my yaw, they can't imitate it
Tough and rowdy reckless
Rough around the edges
Ever since you came around I've been
Thinking thoughts that I need to get out so I
I grabbed a pen and a napkin and I wrote this down
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you
Yeah, I know it might sound a little elementary
Like a nursery rhyme straight up from the country
It won't pass for Shakespeare, girl I know it
But I'ma pour my heart out like a backboard's poet
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I'm wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you
Yeah, my tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I'm wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you
Yes, I do
That grass ain't gonna cut itself
And you can't get your tan
Underneath these covers
And that four blade ceiling fan
You know I love to see you
With that two piece top untied
But I can think of something better
I ain't gonna lie
Yeah I could use a little rain
Beating on a window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing
A love song all day long
Yeah, I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah that's the kind of storm
That's been calling my name
Yeah I could use a little rain
Yeah I could use a little rain
Blame it on a fast lane
Tryna make that dollar bill
How everything we gotta do
We can't just sitting still
I know that it ain't your fault
And I hope that it ain't mine
But we been in a drought
For a little too long a time
Yeah I could use a little rain
Beating on a window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing
A love song all day long
Yeah, I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah that's the kind of storm
That's been calling my name
Yeah I could use a little rain
Yeah I could use a little rain
Sun, sun, go away
Come again some other day
Me and this girl got love to make
Yeah we got love to make
Sun, sun, go away
Won't ya come again some other day
For me and this girl got love to make
Yeah I could use a little rain
Beating on a window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing
A love song all day long
Yeah, I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah that's the kind of storm
That's been calling my name
Yeah I could use a little rain
Yeah I could use a little rain
Yeah I could use a little rain
Yeah I could use a little rain
You say you need a couple credits 'fore they let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with your daddy's card
You're lookin' like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're gettin when you go to the bar
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So what you say we get on out?
To see where this night leads
If I know me, I have you hoppin' up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate is home
Honey, when the sun comes peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're wakin' up next to me
If I know me
If I know me
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself
If I know me, I have you hoppin' up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate is home
Honey, when the sun comes peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're wakin' up next to me
If I know me
I could just change my mind
And leave my number in your phone
Give you a kiss good night
And go home alone
But if I know me, I have you hoppin' up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate is home
Honey, when the sun comes peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're wakin' up next to me
If I know me
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those good bye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a Queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
I see you dancing with Mr. Handsome
He looks like he's a real romancer
I'm just hoping and I'm praying that one day I hear you saying
That you gon' give me that second chance and take me back
And we gon' roll through life in a Cadillac
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a Queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
No I ain't
I'll buy you flowers, talk for hours
Write your name up on the water tower
Keep you covered up in diamonds
Make your smile light up just like 'em
I'm gon' "Yes M'am" you "No M'am" you, open up your door
N' I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a Queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time
I'm gonna "Yes M'am" you "No M'am" you, open up your door
N' I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a Queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time
That DJ on the side stage ain't played one song I like
It's all craft beer sold in here, can't even get a cold Bud Light
I see you sittin' over there barely sippin' your drink
Lookin' like you might need a little scenery change
Got a spot I've been hittin' since back in the day
What ya say we slip away and say to hell with this place?
Go get a little gone girl on the black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
Gone like that six pack, we gonna tip back on my hood
Gone like our Levis, I was gonna hang 'em on an old dogwood
Yeah the thought of you and me in the back 40
With the trees and the bees and the birds
Can't think of nothin' better but baby no pressure
Really all you gotta do is say the word
And we can get a little gone girl on the black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
'Til it's gone girl
So baby let's roll, take a few backroad curves
Roll 'til we find a little heaven on Earth
Let's get a little gone girl on the black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
Take a few backroad curves, yeah 'til it's gone girl
Find a little heaven on Earth, 'til it's gone girl
Maybe it's your bad girl underneath that sweet smile
Like a peak of black lace that nobody but me sees
And just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl, is my weakness
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Whoa, girl, I try to be
But I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
You know what you do girl, and you know what it does to me
When you turn on that song and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone before the part about you
Dancing in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leaning it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Whoa, girl, I try to be
But I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Can't tell you no, can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I try
'Cause when I look in your eyes...
I'm not good at not kissing again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Whoa, girl, I try to be
But I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
Not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
I'm not good at not fallin'
I'm not good at not fallin' in love
I'm not good at not fallin'
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love
You say them city boys living in those high rise condos
Only left you feeling low
Those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast
But never got you where you wanted to go
All I've ever owned is an old C, Chevy truck
Cuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat
Don't mind me I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering those
Little sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me, talkin' Tennessee
You say those street lights only ever let you see the skyline
It's been a long time
Since the Milky Way, Jupiter and Venus took your breath away
Yeah like you're taking mine
What you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars
Catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar
Don't mind me I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go let my south side show whiskey whispering those
Little sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me, talkin' Tennessee,
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering those
Little sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me talkin' Tennessee
Talkin' Tennessee
Talkin' Tennessee
She asked me where I was from
I said somewhere you've never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talking with my accent
We held hands and waded into that blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I said, "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said, "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"
So we drank bottom shelf
She said, "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said, "Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home" and she said
"Maybe I should see 'em for myself"
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I said, "Meet me in the morning"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen
To my head, and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you
A 'Bama red 4-Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
I bought a Harvard sweatshirt off the Goodwill rack
Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar laying on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do
But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say, "There ain't no way that she's with him"
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
And this attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
There's no end to the lies that I could get 'em to believe
But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say, "There ain't no way that she's with him"
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
Must of done something right, something right
In another life
'Cause nobody buys it when we walk in
They say, "There ain't no way that she could be with him"
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
Aw, ain't no one more surprised than me
And Jack D., there's a seven on the label
One glass on the living room table
Phone face down, church up loud
Was trying to drown you out tonight
But first sip, I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me feelin' colder
Thought a drink would get you off my mind, but
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call, and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
You might think I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changing what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor, try another brand
But it don't matter if I got my lips on a different drink
On a different night
Yeah, the second that I take a sip, all I'm gonna think is
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call, and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Thought a drink would get you off my mind
I ain't sayin' I love you, but I might 'cause
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call, and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
This bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
That neon sign
Hangin' outside that bar
Should've said, "Go home
If you know what's good for your heart"
When she sat down
In that ADPi T-shirt
Should've said, "Watch out
And boy, you're gonna wind up hurt"
And that label on that whiskey on that shelf
Should've said, "Don't buy no shots for no one else"
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pouring (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the morning
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warning (Ooh)
Should've come with a warning
Phone just lit up
And it's damn near 2am
Oughta be blue lights, or some kind of loud sirens
Sayin' don't pick it up, she'll let you down
It's the deep end and you're gonna drown
And this, "You up?" text, that she sent me right now
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there don't sip on what they're pouring (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the morning
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warning (Ooh)
Should've come with a warning
Don't fire it up, and hit the headlights
Turn on around at the next red light
I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night
Would've come with a warning (Ooh)
Would've come with a warning
Would've come with a warning (Ooh)
Would've come with a warning
They started out blue like an East Tennessee, June sky
Full of small town innocence guarded by a picket fence perfect till I drove by
You were looking for a way out and I was on my way
Girl, once you love a cowboy you'll never be the same
I know right now you think this is it
But I'm gonna leave you with
Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really getting what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes
Right now they're glowing like the cigarette we just sparked
Aw, but I've seen this scene before like the lights on a liquor store
Pretty soon they'll go dark
I know you're tired of all the same shit, that's why you think you want this
I can show you first-hand, girl, what you wish you'd a missed
But if you won't take it from me, I guess you're gonna have to see through
Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really getting what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes
Neon eyes
I don't wanna be the one to say I told you so
Just let me push you away before you get too close
I can't go and make up your mind
And I don't wanna be the reason behind those
Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really getting what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes
Neon eyes
Neon eyes
Used to be you'd see my face on wanted posters all over this town, mmm
For leading lovers on until the dawn, just riding in and rolling out, mmm
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought
Till you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazing
Bang, bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang, bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightning
Ain't trying to fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth
Guess that makes you an outlaw too
I can't believe you came after me with the crazy reputation that I have, mmm
It takes a hell of an angel to see the good inside a man so bad
But you did
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought
Till you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazing
Bang, bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang, bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightning
Ain't trying to fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth
I guess that makes you an outlaw too
Mmm, yes, it does, baby
I was wild as a west Texas wind
Wild as a cowboy's ever been
Till you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazing
Bang, bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang, bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightning
Ain't trying to fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth
Guess that makes you an outlaw too
You thought I'd die
When you said goodbye
For a minute I thought that I would
And there for awhile
Couldn't even fake a smile
Even if the bad joke sounded good
I went off the rails
Thought hell, might as well
Rock bottom was calling my name
But lookin' back now, I oughta be
In the moving on hall of fame
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
It wasn't old flames
Or dancing with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you
You saw me out
On a Friday downtown
With a smile that came stumbling back in
Guess that killed your mood
'Cause you did what you do
Turned around and walked out again
So pour a little more bourbon
Oh, it's the only thing been working
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
It wasn't old flames
Or dancing with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you
Whiskey'd my way
Whiskey'd my way
Oh, keep the barkeep workin'
Oh, pour it on this hurtin'
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
And it wasn't old flames
Or dancing with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you
Tequila didn't cut it
Cold beer was no use
So I whiskey'd my way over you
I don't know where the hell it comes from
Got no idea where it goes when it leaves
When it's here, it's here
When it's gone, it's gone
Kinda like them smoky mountain, fall time trees
I guess I'll leave it to something bigger to figure it all out
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they want to share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
Why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
She sits there like a feather just waitin' on a gale
By the time I pushed off, she already caught sail
I'm always waiting to put my anchor down
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they want to share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
Why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
Hey, I can taste the rain, I can see the sun
And that makes sense to me
But this feels like one that I can't outrun
Guess I'm runnin' just to see
If anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they want to share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
Why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
And why it always takes her with it
And leaves me hangin' on a limb
Just wonderin' 'bout the wind
Aw wonderin' 'bout the wind
If I was your car
I'd turn you 'round
If I was your radio
I'd play our song right now
If I was your memory of me
I'd keep running, running
Till your fingers started thumbing
Through your phone
And tell me that you're coming home
If I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
Till the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heart break song
On the jukebox till your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinking, get you thinking
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leaving me
If I was your bible
I'd turn the page to forgiveness
If I was your bed
I'd be ice cold without me in it
If I was your dream
I'd keep running, running
Through your mind
Till there was nothing you could do
But call me up out of the blue
Yeah
If I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
Till the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heart break song
On the jukebox till your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinking, get you thinking
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leaving me
Yeah, I wish I was
'Cause if I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
Till the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heart break song
On a jukebox till your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinking, get you thinking
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leaving me
Yeah, yeah
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leaving
I'd talk you out of leaving
I'd talk you out of leaving me
She told me where I could go
Just stopped in here before I went
And I'll be here until you close
Or all my money's spent
So if you don't mind my friend
Bartender pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone
Here's a hundred and some change
I'll take whatever that'll buy
Leave a twenty for the band
If they'll lay off lonesome songs tonight
And whenever you get time
Bartender pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone, oh no
Bartender pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone=
And I ain't got nowhere to be
And I'd rather not go home
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone
A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun you can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more tried to shoot out the sun
Days when we raged, we flew off the page such damage was done
But I made it through, cause somebody knew I was meant for someone
So girl, leave your boots by the bed we ain't leaving this room
Till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress in Richmond on high
But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff forever, this time
And the old lovers sing "I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen till you came along
So girl, hang your dress out to dry we ain't leaving this room
Till Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So girl, leave your boots by the bed we ain't leaving this room
Till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost soul found, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost soul found, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks a back road gets old
But for me, it just can't
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cut offs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cut offs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cut offs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
I need to lean on a truck with five old friends
Tell old lies and then tell 'em again
Ride 33 till it hits the river
Throw cans in the bed till the moon's just a sliver
Wanna see my name on a dive bar wall
Where the ceilings ain't, but the beers are tall
There's something 'bout a city like this
Makes me miss what I grew up with
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
I need to hear mama pray till the rolls get cold
For them hometown folks that she says I know
My soul's a little dirty 'cause my boots are too clean
It's been too long since I've seen
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Yeah, I bet by now they're missin' me
So I ain't stopping' till I see
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass losin' everything in my billfold
Ooh, that's what I do when I'm drinkin' about you
So, I don't want to go downtown
Doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell, I got enough loose screws
I'm gettin' tired of hurtin 'bout ya
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous, 'cause that could be dangerous
I could see me doin' just fine with a daisy duke dime, but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryin' to drink you gone
So, I don't want to go downtown
Doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell, I've got enough loose screws
I'm getting' tired of hurtin' 'bout ya
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous, 'cause that could be dangerous
Yeah, 'cause you
Got somebody else that you've been foolin'
Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
Ooh, I'd usually be the type to be out
Too but you ruined that for me
So
I don't want to go downtown
Doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell, I've got enough loose screws
I'm getting' tired of hurtin' 'bout ya
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous, 'cause that could be dangerous
Dangerous, that could be dangerous
Map dot, southern rock, buckshot, stop sign
Grizz packed, mantle rack, channel cat, trot line
Pipes ain't Bristol, but they pretty loud though
'Round here the sun goes down slow
But beer don't
Home base, that's the party spot at the Walmart
2nd base in the parking lot at the ballpark
Sweet cherry pie slice in the boondocks
Skillets and the engines and the women stay hot, but
Beer don't start nothing, but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't
Big boss on ya back 'bout to get a cuss out
Scopes off, low shot, didn't lay the buck down
Baby says, "Bye" and it down right breaks ya
Hey, just remember when you think the world hates ya
Beer don't start nothing, but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't
One beer, two beer, three beer, four
There's twenty more of 'em behind the fridge door
Five beer, six beer, seven beer, eight
You can keep count, but I'll tell ya who ain't
Beer don't start nothing, but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't
Yeah, beer don't
But beer don't
If you get a little dirt on your new boots
If you roll in late to work from hittin' snooze
If them school boys ain't got no luck 'cause you start turnin' your nose up
At them downtown lights 'cause they ain't your kind of view
I hope the next boy that falls for ya don't blame you
If you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
If your friends start asking you what's going on
'Cause all you wanna hear is them country songs
If you start takin' gravel roads and stopping off at Texacos
And you wanna watch the full moon all night long, it's my fault
If you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
Forgive me if I set the bar too high
With a 6 pack and a bass boat fishtail slide
If them weekend boys get boring, I don't mean to wreck it for ya
Yeah, it's my bad girl if you had the time of your life
It's all right
If you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
Aw blame it on, aw blame it on
Baby, blame it on me
I rolled in bumpin' 10s into Broadway
Dirty boots been a working like a dog day
Boot scootin' to the juke for some Conway
Or anything to get my Honky Tonk on
You walked in, cutoffs looking real skimpy
The hottest thing my side of the Mississippi
And I could spin you 'round and 'round till I get you dizzy
But you look like you got hillbilly in your bones


So let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna
But if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you
I got a 4x4 with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
You got a drank you're barely sipping
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country
I'll close the tab quick
We can go get half lit
Hit the river, skinny dip, or catch a catfish
Yeah, I'll take you to the holler
I ain't talking 'bout a hollow
Put some red on the tread
Hell, I'll wash it off tomorrow
Let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna
But if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you
I got a 4x4 with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
You got a drank you're barely sipping
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country
Whatcha say, whatcha say
We can take a little stroll, maybe roll in some hay
What's it gon' be, what's it gon' be
Shorty, if you wanna get your Back Forty on with me
Then let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna
But if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you
I got a 4x4 with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue

Girl whatcha say we do somethin' country
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Buzzing all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this
Couldn't wait to turn 21
The day I did I got too drunk
Spinnin' round dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out of towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Buzzing all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes we hit it off
Year down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
We had it good and it hurt so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Learning how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Lights and kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was looking for
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain't it strange the things you keep tucked in your heart?
I found myself in this bar
I don't wanna go to work
I don't wanna see my ex-girl
I don't wanna worry 'bout finding me my next girlfriend
At the bar where they charge your right arm for a cold can of PBR
Yeah, I don't wanna watch the news
I don't wanna pick the phone up
Don't wanna sit in traffic with an empty can of long cut
I've been doin' what I should be doin', and I'm losin' my Dodge Ram mind
'Cause I just wanna do country ass shit
With my country ass friends
With my country ass band
Havin' to make them dollar bills y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels y'all
Between workin' it off
And gettin' it chewed
They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass
Goin' fishin'
Yeah I just wanna drink a beer
I just wanna get a line wet
Let the sun put some more red on my neck
Wave at the girls on their rental pontoons
While my bass boat speakers go boom, boom
'Cause I just wanna do country ass shit
With my country ass friends
With my country ass band
Havin' to make them dollar bills y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels y'all
Between workin' it off
And gettin' it chewed
They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass
Goin' fishin'
Don't wanna shake no hands or tuck my shirt in
Pardon my French Mama if you're listening, but
I just wanna do country ass shit
With my country ass friends
With my country ass band
Havin' to make them dollar bills y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels y'all
Between workin' it off
And gettin' it chewed
They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass
Goin' fishin'
(They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans)
(But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it)
'Cause me and my country ass
Goin' fishin'
When I met ya I was chillin' to some old Willie
Bet you were thinking, "How'd I get up with this hillbilly?"
Saw yourself sittin' pretty in the big city
And now you're big-time digging on some little bitty
Backroads, real slow, got your hand out the window
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama, said it's gonna be a while, ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?
Aw baby, now you've seen the way my sun sets
From a blanket on a bank of a creek bed
And I can tell you were hooked soon as you said
Don't take me home, boy I ain't had enough yet
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama, said it's gonna be a while, ha
Didn't think way out was your style
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think about the pine trees?
Hey, whatcha think about the cool breeze?
And whatcha think about the midnight moon?
Aw damn, this country looks good on you
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama, said it's gonna be a while, ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?
Aw baby, whatcha think of country now?
Mmm, but now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
I know we made a downtown reservation
Let's get there early, get drunk, and break it
There's cabs outside
We could wave and take one
To that little dive bar you like
I know you got your red dress on, but
It was always gonna come back off
So go on and call me crazy
We both know it's just a matter of time
Baby, with
Me on whiskey, and you on wine
Getting Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink, I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
Let's get started on an all-night nightcap
That won't wind down until the break of dawn
And we can keep it rollin' like that 'cause
Right about now, it don't sound wrong
Girl, I know you got all dressed up
Yeah, and now we're getting all messed up
We don't just do it 'cause we're good at it
Yeah, we do it 'cause
We find some good things happen with
Me on whiskey, and you on wine
Getting Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink, I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
Girl, I know you got your red dress on
Sittin' pretty on that old barstool and
We don't ever get enough of this
It's pretty simple, baby, all it is, it's
Me on whiskey, and you on wine
Getting Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink, I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
This whiskey sure tastes fine right now
But it ain't doing the trick, no
It ain't getting me gone enough
To make my mind forget
That one shot, two shot, three shot more
Don't change the fact
She ain't in the picture anymore
This bar stool ain't working
But if anything can
It'll be me on a dock pushing off of dry land
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some rodding and some reeling, first catch feeling
Praying to the man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat
Don't care if it's a pontoon, brand new, been used
Long as it'll fish
Just wanna cast it out yonder, let my mind wander
Off to anything, but this
I'm tired of running into all my friends
Asking if I'm over her loving
Yeah, but out there where the river lets in
Them fish don't ask me nothing
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some rodding and some reeling, first catch feeling
Praying to the man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need some peace and quiet
I don't know who the hell is gonna buy it
Yeah, but I need a boat
Uh, huh
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some rodding and some reeling, first catch feeling
Praying to the man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need a boat
Real, real bad
Never thought I'd be calling you up today
Taking out an ad for this Chevrolet
But there's a ring in the window just down the street
I wanna marry her, she wants to marry me
Money's kinda tight, but love don't care
Me and this truck been everywhere
Just need a little spot on the back page
Here's what I want it to say
This truck will get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio
If you wanna get her dancin' down an old dirt road
Spent a lot of Friday nights up under the stars
Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far
God knows all the stories it can tell
I got a Silverado for sale
Don't you think there's a wild-eyed teenage kid
Workin' hard all summer just like I did
Saved up a couple thousand bucks
And got a girl that he's dyin' to go pick up
She'll steal his heart on that old bench seat
He'll wanna lay the world right there at her feet
I can see him smiling ear to ear
When he reads these words right here
This truck'll get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio
If you wanna get her dancin' down an old dirt road
Spent a lot of Friday nights up under the stars
Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far
God knows all the stories it can tell
I got a Silverado for sale
Hello? Yeah, I'm the guy
I've got 'er all cleaned up
Just come on by
This truck will get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio

Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far

Heartless (Heartless, heartless)
So heartless (So heartless, so heartless)
Say you're going out late
I count down till you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell and you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself
But, why you gotta be so heartless
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finished what we started
Girl why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night we went out on the town
Saturday we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah ohh
I should probably know this shit by now
But no, no
Why you gotta be so heartless
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finished what we started
Girl why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Girl why you gotta be so in between
Loving me and leaving, leaving
Ah ohh
I should probably know this shit by now
But no, no
Why you gotta be so heartless
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finished what we started
Girl why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Girl why you gotta be so heartless
(So heartless, so heartless)
Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Adderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Sign my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' a dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' a dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' a dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Puttin' in that overtime and comin' up with nothin'
Sure as hell ain't for lack of tryin'
There's no use wastin' time in fightin' for somethin'
When you see that white flag a flyin'
Can you hear that whistle blow?
There's all day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find
If rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
There's somethin' to be said for sayin' what needs sayin'
A suitcase says it all to me
Before the credits roll just know I always loved you
So we wrote that famous final scene
Where you turn and walk out on me
There's all day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find
If rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
Give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
It's quittin' time
Every start has an end
Every first has a last
Every now has a then
Every future has a past
And sometimes you want it back
There's all day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find
If rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now


Give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
It's quittin' time
I put the same pedal down, on the same metal slung
The same gravel goodbye high
I burned the same bridges up, with the same finger up
She got out the driver's side
So I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever comin' back
It's usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
She's burnin' unleaded and my own medicine
Tastes more bitter than sweet
Her tires are turnin' and the tables are too
Never seen a broken heart from this point of view
It's usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
So I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever comin' back
Yeah, I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever lookin' back
It's usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
Goes around, comes around, came around and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
On this side of a dust cloud
Girl since you left me
Been tryin' to forget we
Ever became what we were
And I poured some whiskey
On places you kissed me
Tried to wash off all the hurt
But ain't nothin' workin'
I've lived out the words in
A thousand old sad country songs
But whenever I try to move on
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers, told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
If I was only
Heart broke and lonely
I'd head on back down to the bar
Find me a companion
But you left a canyon
Can't nobody fill in this heart
And girl, it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
And baby tell me how you did it?
I just gotta know
And tell me what's your secret?
And how'd you let me go so easy?
'Cause girl it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
Oh, I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
It's like tryna to put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
Ever since the day
You walked into my life
You flipped me upside down
Took me for a ride
I didn't know how to take it
Or I never seen it coming
Should've just stayed
But I took off running
So now I lie awake in the middle of the night
Tryin' to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life
Just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife
So I've got no right to judge ya
All I know is I'm more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya
Ever since the day
You walked out of my life
You flipped me upside down
Took me for a ride
Thought this was what I wanted
But I never could have imagined
That this is how it'd be
When it actually happened
So now I lie awake in the middle of the night
Tryin' to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life
Just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife
So I've got no right to judge ya
All I know is I'm more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya
I fell so fast, I fell so hard
And all you asked was for me to stay
But I walked away from your heart
Now I lie awake in the middle of the night
Tryin' to figure out what to do
And I know now that I need you in my life
Just like you always knew
I was a fool and I cut you like a knife
So I've got no right to judge ya
All I know is I'm more scared to live without ya
All I know is I'm more scared to live without ya
Than I am to love ya
Than I am to love ya
Busch Light light on the ice, tidings on the tube
Zapper popping flies out here in the boons
Hah, I'm going nowhere (oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, I know the mountains got the snow, Cali's got the beach
Memphis got the soul, Atlanta's got the beats, but
Y'all, I'm going nowhere (oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I'm stuck in this town, in my truck
Riding round with a plug of long cut in my lip
You'd have to cut the whole tree down
Can't rip these roots out the ground
Ain't getting out and I don't care
'Cause why in the hell would I leave?
I don't need anything but fried chicken and crickets
If there's a yellow pine box, you can carry me in it
This red dirt, you can bury me in it
I'm going nowhere
Alright, Wallen
Where you going?
Yeah, country life is what you make it, you love it or you leave it
I got a reputation, I damn sure plan to keep it
Every bottle, every party, every parking lot fire
Guess all them daughter's daddies were right, I'm going nowhere
Stuck in this town, in my truck
Riding round with a plug of long cut in my lip
You'd have to cut the whole tree down
Can't rip these roots out the ground
Ain't getting out and I don't care
'Cause why in the hell would I leave?
I don't need anything but fried chicken and crickets
If there's a yellow pine box, you can carry me in it
This red dirt, you can bury me in it
I'm going nowhere
Some people get the itch to ditch a dirt road
But that county line sign's as far as I'll go
(Oh-oh-oh)
Because I'm stuck in this town, in my truck
Riding round with a plug of long cut in my lip
You'd have to cut the whole tree down
Can't rip these roots out the ground
Ain't getting out and I don't care
'Cause why in the hell would I leave?
I don't need anything but fried chicken and crickets
If there's a yellow pine box, you can carry me in it
This red dirt, you can bury me in it
I'm going nowhere
Country life is what you make it, you love it or you leave it (going nowhere)
I got a reputation, I damn sure plan to keep it (yeah, I'm going nowhere)
Every bottle, every party, every parking lot fire
Guess all them daughter's daddies were right, I'm going nowhere
Granddaddy drank heavy and daddy drank light
I can turn any day to Saturday night if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It's been a minute since I've had one in my hand 'cause
Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doing the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin' I could sing about, yeah
Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doing the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand
Whoa
I ain't the devil that I acted like years ago
Oh
But I'll be back one day, y'all, even though
Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doing the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand
Born with a beer in my hand
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some ol' high rise town that I won't ever go again
Wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like
We were listen' to "one more silver dollar"
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride
Wish I woulda known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
And can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't care how much they're bitin'
I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd I'd ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now, I'm gonna see you everytime I see that welcome sign
Wish I would've known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
And can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't wanna hear "one more silver dollar"
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride
Wish I would've known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey
'Cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck
And now I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said I got you
Yeah, 'cause I too, have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85, got me over my first wife
Been staying busy since the first night
It's a story old as time
God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl, his best work of art
Oh, but he didn't make no place to go
When she breaks your heart, so man made a bar
For some guys it's a good time
The half price, half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band
That's a cover man, I know why they're here
Didn't go the way he planned it
Damn the devil did some damage
So God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl, his best work of art
Oh, but he didn't make no place to go
When she breaks your heart, so man made a bar
Yeah, man made a bar
And sometimes an angel falls too hard
Loses more than just a piece of her heart
And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start
God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
God made a man, man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl, his best work of art
Oh, but he didn't make no place to go
When she breaks your heart, so man made a bar
Man made a bar
Yeah, man made a bar
There's a bottle on a King James coaster
Miller Lite full of cigarettes
Too drunk to be hungover
Last night still on my breath
There ain't no startin' over
And this over never ends
I've been tryin' to drown these demons
Ah, but damn if they don't swim
What's keepin' me up all night
Is knowing what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on
Seeing you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level
Girl even the devil don't know this kinda hell
It ain't the one out of Revelation
Nah, it's way too cold for that
It's the heartbreak that won't stop
Everywhere you're not
And everything I can't get back
What's keepin' me up all night
Is knowing what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on
Seeing you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level
Girl even the devil don't know this kinda hell
It ain't what I did to get here
Nah, it's everything I didn't
And no, I can't tell you where Heaven is
But I know right where it isn't
What's keepin' me up all night
Is knowing what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on
Seeing you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level
Girl even the devil don't know this kinda hell
Don't know that kinda hell
Nah, the devil don't know
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been getting better by the day but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you
And get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options
And take your pick
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby I'll take all the help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey
Some grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop loving you
Hey whatchu want me to do
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
I ain't no superman
I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on
Then I need me something in my hand
Ain't nothing wrong with that
If you ain't coming back
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
I remember sittin' at that house
Livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big 3 pitchers
Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Joneses
But as fate would have it
That Atlanta magic got put out by them damn Padres
And I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day
We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some
It ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team and love was a game
We would have been the '98 Braves
Had that whole town believin'
Damn girl I even had that talk
To your dad man to man
But just like that season
Girl you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand
We got close but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some
It ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team and love was a game
We would have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves
You win some, you lose some
It ain't always home runs
Girl, it coulda gone either way
But if we were a team and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
If we were a team and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves
Oh yeah girl, we'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves
We'd have been the '98 Braves
I remember sittin' at that house
Livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Ain't that some back home buddies in a field mud on the wheels
Yeah, ain't that some thick smoke Silverado tearin' up a two lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Man, ain't that some shit
That you'd hate to grow up and miss
Hate to think of what if
I didn't even know what a honey hole with a Zebco
And my jeans rolled and a pinch of Skoal in my lip even is
They say we ain't got a pot to piss but I thank God for this
Ain't that some back home buddies in a field mud on the wheels
Yeah, ain't that some thick smoke Silverado tearin' up a two lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Yeah
My true north is due south, with a blue Coors goin' down
Just like that setting sun on my old Z71
I know it's cliché to sing Chevrolets, cold beers and Fridays
But that's just the way it is out here
Ain't that some back home buddies in a field mud on the wheels
Yeah, ain't that some thick smoke Silverado tearin' up a two lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some back home buddies in a field mud on the wheels
Yeah, ain't that some thick smoke Silverado tearin' up a two lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Ain't that some back home
Ain't that some thick smoke Silverado
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, we'll be doing this till the day we die
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y'd this
Ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some shit
When it comes to hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs, to catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book, yeah, I wrote the book
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
Catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades, but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
I met a good girl, she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everything
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades, but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it, but I probably oughta read it
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades, but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write
Used to be our picture
From her sister's wedding day
There on her lock screen
Now it's just some ocean waves
Used to be a buncha hearts
Right there beside my name
She used to never miss one
But these days that girl just let's it ring
Ah, but if she don't one day
I'd say
Damn it's good to hear your voice
Feels like it's been forever
Ask her how's her mom and them
And how's that west coast weather?
Yeah, I know it's late I'm sorry
No, I swear I ain't that drunk
I know she won't and I don't blame her
But if she ever picked it up
I'd tell her it's my fault and I still love her
But she quit taking calls from Tennessee numbers
I bet she hides her accent
So no one asks her where she's from
And steers clear of whiskey
'Cause it stirs them memories up
And there's a boy from back home
That she still won't talk about
If he could talk to her right now
He'd say
Damn it's good to hear your voice
Feels like it's been forever
Ask her how's her mom and them
And how's that west coast weather?
Yeah, I know it's late I'm sorry
No, I swear I ain't that drunk
I know she won't and I don't blame her
But if she ever picked it up
I'd tell her it's my fault and I still love her
But she quit taking calls from Tennessee numbers
From Tennessee numbers
I used to be the one
But now I'm just an 8-6-5
If I could just talk to her
Maybe I could change her mind
And I'd say
Damn it's good to hear your voice
Feels like it's been forever
Ask her how's her mom and them
And how's that west coast weather?
Yeah, I know it's late I'm sorry
No, I swear I ain't that drunk
I know she won't and I don't blame her
But if she ever picked it up
I'd tell her it's my fault and I still love her
But she quit taking calls from Tennessee numbers
Tennessee numbers
I hate that S-Class Benz
That you're so damn proud of
You hate my truck
'Cause you can't climb out of it
And I'll admit it, girl
I said it and I meant it
Yeah, I loved you for a minute
But we damn sure different
It's been a week since you went and hit the highway
You made it clear that I oughta have it my way
But my way looks a whole lot better
With just my truck in the driveway
And I hope you find you a high rollin' high rise view
That you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy
With some dollar sign eyes and a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think
That I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever gonna find nobody just like you
Well, I hope that's true
You got drunk one night
And told me I was white trash
I was high but I guess I wasn't high class
Enough to show up with you on your arm
We were never gonna be two kids on a farm
And I hope you find you a high rollin' high rise view
That you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy
With some dollar sign eyes and a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think
That I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever
Gonna find nobody just like you
I hope that's true
I could sit here bitter and bitchin'
And wishing things woulda gone different
But that don't sound nothin' like me at all
Honey, who the hell am I kiddin'
And I hope you find you a high rollin' high rise view
That you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy
With some dollar sign eyes and a pocket full of money
And it ain't that I want you to think
That I hate every single little thing you do
But when you say that I ain't ever gonna find nobody just like you
I hope that's true
Yeah, I hope that's true
Oh, I hope that's true
I hope that's true
Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothing new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye
Looks like I did it again
Me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in the wall
And I gotta drink my way out
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah, I need a
Corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good-time, cold-beer crowd
It's just me, Jack, and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends
We just need a slow song
Tryin' to let her go song
Throw a little Jones on
Leave us alone till she's long gone
Got a lot of over her work left to do
That we need to get into
So bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah, I need a
Corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good-time, cold-beer crowd
It's just me, Jack, and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends
Me and my whiskey friends
Looks like I did it again
Me and my stupid mouth
Dug myself into a hole in the wall
Now I gotta drink my way out
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah, I need a
Corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good-time, cold-beer crowd
It's just me, Jack, and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends
Me and my whiskey friends
Play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey
For me and my whiskey friends
On my Fridays when it's whiskey, I go back to Cincy
That Ohio night you tricked me into buying all your shots
Got your ghost up in my Chevy, shotgun lookin' ready
For them parties where you'd let me spin you 'round and show you off
I been tryin' to get away from you for a while now
But there ain't no settin' you down
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run
You're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, love me till the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You keep comin' up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
Comin' up at 8AM, 9AM
All the way to 10PM when my day ends
Layin' down and there you are in my Amens
Mornin' light and you're there on my mind again
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run
You're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, love me till the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', you keep comin'
There ain't no blinds to close, covers to throw over my head
Ever since you left
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run
You're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, love me till the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
Yeah, you keep comin' up
I'm no stranger to the rain
It starts rainin', I start pourin'
I'll take hurt like hell in the mornin'
Over feeling this way
There ain't a mirror in this house anymore
'Cause it kills me to see
The guy that let you leave
And walk right out the door
Kentucky bluebird, Kentucky bourbon
Sure got this ole boy hurtin' in Tennessee
Good whiskey, girl, it just don't last
When Keith Whitley, keeps bringin' ya up like that
Gets me drinkin' 'bout us and what it was
The things I love got a way of gettin' gone too soon
Kinda like good whiskey, Keith Whitley and you
I hate the way you say nothing at all
I guess you said what you had to say
But what's killin' me tonight
Is when he's lovin' on you, baby, you don't close your eyes
Good whiskey, girl, it just don't last
When Keith Whitley, keeps bringin' ya up like that
Gets me drinkin' 'bout us and what it was
The things I love got a way of gettin' gone too soon
Kinda like good whiskey, Keith Whitley and you
Miami, my Amy
You sure got this ole boy hurtin' up here in Tennessee
Good whiskey, girl, it just don't last
When Keith Whitley, keeps bringin' ya up like that
Gets me drinkin' 'bout us and what it was
The things I love got a way of gettin' gone too soon
Kinda like good whiskey, Keith Whitley and you
Paint your truck tread with some red dust
While you kick up the long way home
Share some bootleg with your best buds
Wear a bit of that bonfire smoke
If a back porch swing and twang in your words
And settin' that hook was a Good Book verse
I'd be doin' alright
I'd know where I's goin' when I get to the other side 'cause
Backroads and cold beer
Are my down-home prayer
Can't get no closer
To the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
If "John Deere Green" was 3:16
And old barstools were back pew seats
These Friday nights would all just seem like Sunday mornin'
If them words in red were a little more read
This sinner'd be a saint instead
'Cause backroads and cold beer
Are my down-home prayer
Can't get no closer
To the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
'Cause backroads and cold beer
Are my down-home prayer
Can't get no closer to God's grace, I swear
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I oughta get my money back
And someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' jack
Yeah, I've been sippin', I've been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'
Aw, but nothin' makes you go away
I need something "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"
Poured 'em up till they're shutting 'em down, yeah
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give 'em all my money
Ain't nobody sellin' nothing "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"
Hey, I've been mixing liquors tryin' to get you gone
Aw, but I must be doin' somethin' wrong
'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory
Baby, but the only thing faded is me
I need something "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
I need something "You proof"
Poured 'em up till they're shutting 'em down, yeah
Aw, I need something "You proof"
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give up all my money
Ain't nobody sellin' nothing "You proof"
What's goin' on, Mama?
Somethin' just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women
Makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much
Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and
She let's me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know, thought you should know
Oh, by the way, Mama
Didn't mean to ramble on ya
How's everything back at home?
Yeah, how's that garden comin'?
Is dad still doing dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?
Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late
I just miss you, but anyways
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and
She let's me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know, thought you should know
Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
That I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and
It turns out, she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
The bus is leavin', so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know, thought you should know
I thought you should know, thought you should know
I thought you should know, thought you should know
Thought you should know
Yeah, I bet she's
Topped off that two-tone tank at the Texaco
Before she hits the road
I bet she's
Pissed off enough to pick herself up a pack of smokes
Even though she don't


Flip a quarter
Roll the dice
It's a left
Or it's a right
One's goin' my way
And one's hell on a highway
Heads, it's headlights headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss me?
Tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Yeah, tonight it's lookin' F150-50
And I know Detroit
Done bolted down and don't mess around
Underneath that hood
And them horses are running good
So the only thing that's breakin' down
Is maybe that girl's breakin' down
Behind the wheel and I'm breakin' down the odds tonight
Heads, it's headlights headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss me?
Tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Am I holdin' on to her tonight or just the whiskey?
Is she better off without me or right here with me?
Yeah, tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Heads, it's headlights headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss me?
Tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Yeah, tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Is she better off without me or right here with me?
Yeah, tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Yeah, I'm down bad
She slammed that door and she broke my heart
That girl sure got out of town fast
She bounced
So I bounced in here tryna bounce back
Ooh, I know I probably oughta throw a couple prayers up
To the man upstairs
Ooh, instead of watchin' this bottle that was filled up
Just disappear
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a u-turn in your car
Don't know why I do 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gonna take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Girl, it happens every damn time
You pour it on strong and before too long
This old number 7's on round nine
A lot of dive bar down time
Yeah
And ooh, I know I probably oughta throw a couple prayers up
To the man upstairs
Ooh, instead of lettin' this heart stay beat down
Pullin' up this chair
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a u-turn in your car
Don't know why I do 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gonna take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
You ain't the only one up so high
Make a little room 'cause so am I
I need a little help gettin' sleep tonight
So I'm singin' me a country boy lullaby, like
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a u-turn in your car
Don't know why I do 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gonna take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a u-turn in your car
Don't know why I do 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby what's it gonna take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Neon star
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
I been doin' good, so good
I been on my best behavior
I been livin' by the book
I shoulda known that sooner or later
You'd walk in this place and I'd break
Take two steps back and say
What's one little taste gonna hurt?
You're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight I deserve a drink
What am I supposed to do? Girl, I always lose to your temptation
You're another shot that I shouldn't knock back but damn, baby
You're layin' it on, you're leanin' it in
Yeah, I been keepin' it strong for so long
But I need it again, yeah, I need you again
'Cause you're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight I deserve a drink
I deserve a drink
I been doin' good, so good
I been on my best behavior
You're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight your eyes are tellin' me things
Like I, I deserve a drink
I deserve a drink
Some girls like roses and a man sayin' sorry by the dozen
To heal the heartbreak up, and
Some girls like a letter on a windshield, pourin' out his feelings
When it's all hit the ceilin'
But I know something even better I could try, so
I'm out here soakin' up your porch light glow
With an apology in my left hand
Hope it tastes like a second chance
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass
Of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass
Without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems
And this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
A little olive branch romance, drink it off our minds
Till that twenty minute fight's ancient history
Baby, I just hope you'll forgive me
I'm tipsy, come kiss me, by the time it's empty
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass
Of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass
Without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems
And this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
And I know, girl, I'm probably walkin' on a tightrope
But I can see you holdin' back a smile, so
Whatchu say we don't stop
Till we get to the last drop
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass
Of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass
Without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems
And this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
Smoke on my clothes, liquor on my breath
Devil on my shoulder, strangers in my bed
Pills in my pocket, ashes on the floor
These bad decisions keep on knockin' on my door
I know you think you left me all alone
I hate to say you couldn't be more wrong, got
Copenhagen, whiskey straight, and
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around came back 'round to
Sunday mornin' still asleep, and
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons
Like all the lies I ever told, that change I never did
All the times that I was cold, all that broke you couldn't fix
I know you did just what you had to do
You looked around and saw there wasn't no room for you, just
Copenhagen, whiskey straight, and
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around came back 'round to
Sunday mornin' still asleep, and
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons
All your reasons
I know you wanna be the one for me
No wonder why you had to run from me
Hell, even I done had enough of me
Now all I got to keep me company, is some
Copenhagen, whiskey straight, and
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around came back 'round to
Sunday mornin' still asleep, and
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons
It's just me and all your reasons
All your reasons
They beat us every damn year
It's been a minute since we pulled out a win
I loaded the truck down with beer
Drove down to watch 'em do it again
And they did so we went to the bar right after
Met a girl with a houndstooth print of her chapter
On her shirt and it turned into talking all night
She came back with me cross the Vol state line
Guess the jokes on Alabama 'cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she's been a Tennessee fan
She likes riding on them winding roads
The smell of sweet pine in the air
I took her about as high as you could go, ha
You can still see Tuscaloosa from there
And all the girls back home say how could you love him
All them boys probably hate me for taking her from 'em
Lord knows her mom and daddy's jaw would drop
If they heard her singing every word of Rocky Top
Guess the jokes on Alabama 'cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she's been a Tennessee fan
Oh
Yeah it's alright let's just call it even
'Cause she's all mine
And she ain't ever leaving
And she's damn fine in orange every weekend
From now on
Yeah she found home
Looks like the jokes on Alabama 'cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick blonde hair red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky mountain man
She was raised roll tide till the day she died
But ever since that night she's been a Tennessee fan
Oh she's been a Tennessee fan
If you're lookin' for a drink, if you're lookin' for a dance
If you're lookin' for a wreck in your Friday night plans
Lookin' for your name in a heart on the wall
Lookin' for a number you ain't ever gonna call again
I got ya, I'll type it in
But, baby, if you're looking for
A sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me
Gotta know when it's golden, gotta know when to fold 'em
Never count on a heart like mine
'Cause I'm an up-in-the-air swinging ferris wheel chair
Might end up stuck in the sky again
So I don't wanna waste your time
If what you're tryin' to find tonight is
A sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me
To be there in the morning
Anything more than a short memory
If that's what you need we can leave
But, baby, if you're looking for
A sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Man, honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me
I wouldn't put my money on me
Don't know where you at
Don't know where you've been
Don't know nothing 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you
But I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothing but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin' are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' bout me?
Comin' over tonight
Wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed
Am I up in your head?
Making you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout? Are you thinkin' 'bout?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?\
Do you hide your phone?
Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't?
Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin' are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight
Wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed
Am I up in your head?
Making you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout? Are you thinkin' 'bout?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Don't know where you at
Girl, I know where you oughta be
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin' are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin' are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight
Wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed
Am I up in your head?
Making you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout me?
She had two beers on the counter when I found her
That neon wrapped right around her like a smoky halo
We talked for almost an hour over sours
I told her, "Girl, tell me how you're in this bar all alone?"
She said she was meetin' someone, seein' someone
But all I know
Is he didn't show and
She let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
She drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots to closin' time
I got her number and name
I ain't sayin'
Her and her mans got any plans on breakin' up
But I tell you what
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was
I bet he'll blame all the traffic
Tell her he got distracted
But I tell you right now that gal's body was actin'
Like she was missin' somethin'
Like he just isn't someone
That learned from the last time
Maybe that's why
She let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
She drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots to closin' time
I got her number and name
I ain't sayin'
Her and her mans got any plans on breakin' up
But I tell you what
She's a little more single than she was
She could be leading me on, be happy at home
But that look in her eyes looks like she's already gone
'Cause she let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
Drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots to closin' time
I got her number and name
I ain't sayin'
Her and her mans got any plans on breakin' up
But I tell you what
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was
Been playing 20 questions with 24 cans
24/7 till I understand
I sent a prayer up for a helping hand
But it must've got stopped by the ceiling fan I'm staring at
In this half full bed
Looking for a reason that
I ain't found yet
I know how a goodbye sounds when it's pedal down in tail light glow
I know what she said and I won't forget where she told me to go
But hell ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
It's been nights that start with whiskey
And days that end in why
Like why she finally threw in the towel
With her makeup bag and her hand-me-down earrings
And why she never felt the need
To tell me what I did, why she packed her things
And why she left me searching at the bottom of this bourbon
I know how a goodbye sounds when it's pedal down in tail light glow
I know what she said and I won't forget where she told me to go
But hell ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
It's been nights that start with whiskey
And days that end in why
Whether it's them damn I miss you Tuesdays
That keep me up all night
Or them take me way back Wednesdays that drift back through my mind
I know how a goodbye sounds when it's pedal down in tail light glow
I know what she said and I won't forget where she told me to go
But hell ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
It's been nights that start with whiskey
And days that end in why
Aw it's been nights that start with whiskey
And days that end in why
Taking one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Taking one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Taking one last drive down Main
Pedal down anywhere but here
County line or Nashville, I don't care
No brakes to the moon long as you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
When did it all go south?
Wish I could hate this town
Turns out that it's just not big enough for the both of us
So I'm just
Taking one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Taking one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Taking one last drive down Main
Yeah, I can see you now
You'll hit the bar, catch a buzz off a couple drinks
Tell your friends you'll be just fine without me
But I'll be there in your mind when you fall asleep
Bet you dream, I bet you dream about
Me and you making out in the driveway
Now it's all rearview behind me
Baby, somehow we got sideways
So before I hit that highway
Taking one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Taking one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Taking one last drive down Main
Pedal down anywhere but here
County line or Nashville, I don't care
No brakes to the moon long as you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
Taking one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Taking one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Taking one last drive down Main
Say you want a little wild in your Friday
Kinda sick of this same old scene
This neon leaves you lonely, baby
I know what you mean
You're tired of wasting your time
Them other boys, they're always trippin'
Well I know a guy who might just know what you've been missin'
Say you've been lookin' around
All over this little town
Staring at the bar room door
Can't find what you're lookin' for
You've been locked down for a while
You want some more wild and free
I don't know who you're waitin' on but
Kinda sounds like me to me
Kinda sounds like me to me
Well you kinda sorta seem like a little Jim Beam
In your bottle wouldn't hurt so bad
And you need a little more black smoke
Down an old back road than what you had
Yeah, and I might be wrong
But a boy like me might be your type
And my country song
Goes hand in hand with your angel eyes, yeah
Say you've been lookin' around
All over this little town
Staring at the bar room door
Can't find what you're lookin' for
You've been locked down for a while
You want some more wild and free
I don't know who you're waitin' on but
Kinda sounds like me to me
Kinda sounds like me to me
Sounds like, damn right
Hell on wheels
Start you up a fire in an open field
Make you feel a way you ain't felt before
That sounds like
Small town, ride the breeze
Gotta little accent, Tennessee
Little hardheaded
Hard to read, yeah
Sounds like me to me
Say you've been lookin' around
All over this little town
Staring at the bar room door
Can't find what you're lookin' for
You've been locked down for a while
You want some more wild and free
I don't know who you're waitin' on but
Kinda sounds like me to me
Kinda sounds like me to me
A boy gets a guitar and starts writing songs
'Bout whiskey and women and getting too stoned
And he got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, "I don't think Jesus done it that way"
Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasing the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignoring the voices in his head that say
"I don't think Jesus done it this way"
If I was Him I'd say, "To Hell with you, ain't no helping you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm telling you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me
I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray 'cause what else could he do?
He says, "I wish You would've woke me up an easier way"
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
If I was Him I'd say, "To Hell with you, ain't no helping you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm telling you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me
I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
World likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
But Lord knows I ain't perfect, and it ain't my place
And I don't think Jesus done it that way
Are y'all sure that Jesus done it that way?

Glass on the floor
Tears in your eyes
Sheets in a mess
Just a typical night
Slam that door
Drink that wine
Find peace on the porch from the war inside
Yeah, we talk and we talk in circles and end up in between
The hell we're in right now and where we used to be
You can't make it go how you planned it
You can't heal a heart with a bandage
And you sure as hell can't take back what you say
When you're drunk and you're speakin' your mind
Yeah, it's hurtin' me like it hurts you
But it's too late now like a curfew
'Cause I can't give you back all the time that I took
But I'll give you back the rest of your life
Did too much damage
Yeah, I knew what I had when I had it but, girl, I've had it
It's hard to say when to walk away but it's harder to stay when it's over
Tell me, baby, have I gone crazy?
'Cause I don't even feel like I know ya
Yeah, we talk and we talk in circles and end up in-between
The covers, now that's just trouble
'Cause that ain't where we're supposed to be, nah

Did too much damage
Yeah, I knew what I had when I had it but, girl, I've had it
Oh girl, I've had it
She'll set the field on fire just cuttin' across a pasture
She'll have you fallin' for it all and then leave right after
And she got a cold heart
But she got a warm smile
Cut from the same cloth
She kinda buck wild
Little bit angel
Whole lotta outlaw
She's trouble but I'll tell you right now, y'all
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise
Rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride
But it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holding that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise
Rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride
But it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
Come on, cowgirls
Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down, girl
With the wild kind of lovin' you make
For God's sake
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise
Rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride
But it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
Bar lights
Bar stool
Too many
One fool
Long neck
Long hair
Last call, we the first ones outta there
Coulda been the right one
But it went wrong, wrong, wrong
And I bet I know just what to blame it on
Good whiskey, bad decisions
Heartaches from some hard livin'
'Bout as good as I'll be gettin'
Don't know why it always goes like
She's fallin'
I'm quittin'
Knew better
Didn't listen
New story
Same endin'
Good girl, gone missin'
Wake up
Hungover
Cold call
Cold shoulder
Too late
Too little
And I'm somewhere stuck in the middle
Of a goodnight and a goodbye
And she's gone and there ain't no wonderin' why
'Cause of me and my
Good whiskey, bad decisions
Heartaches from some hard livin'
'Bout as good as I'll be gettin'
Don't know why it always goes like
She's fallin'
I'm quittin'
Knew better
Didn't listen
New story
Same endin'
Good girl, gone missin'
I'm gettin' stoned all alone in the country 'cause my baby's gone
And I'll never know if she loved me 'cause I don't know how to hold on
'Cause of
Good whiskey, bad decisions
Heartaches from some hard livin'
'Bout as good as I'll be gettin'
Don't know why it always goes like
She's fallin'
I'm quittin'
Knew better
Didn't listen
New story
Same endin'
Good girl, gone missin'
Good girl, gone missin'
Good girl, gone missin'
I used to think that it was me against the world, but it wasn't
Thought drinkin' from a glass half empty made it better, but it doesn't
Funny all the things you realize
When that 20/20 hindsight vision opens up your eyes
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
Something in my ramblin' soul said I had to go toe to toe with the devil
Fell in love with a gypsy girl, said she couldn't risk it on a rebel
At least not one that doesn't have a cause
And I'll admit, I guess back then that's all I really was
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
There's so many crossroads you come to
And you can't put your finger on
Why you went the way you did, and then
You look up and here you are on the flip side of crazy
It's something more than lucky stars you thank when you kiss your baby
Always believed in God and angels in the sky
But never thought that I deserved an angel by my side
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
Yeah, lookin' down, lookin' out for me
I was a bad reputation with an attitude to match
Hell bent on goin' nowhere and gettin' there lightning fast
Twenty-one and looking thirty, but acting half my age
Bound to hit a wall before I ever hit the brakes
Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought something like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dying man
When a Friday meets a Sunday, you can't help but see the light
I never believed in angels till one believed in me that night
Turned my off-track into a straight line
Before I turned into a headline, like
Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought something like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dying man
Whoa
Turned a one-way man 180
Settled down a giving-upper
Yeah, you changed a you-can't-change-me
So the world won't see another
Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought something like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dying man
A set-on-dying man
