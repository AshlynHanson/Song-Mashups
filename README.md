# Music Lyric Mashup
An AI that creates new song lyrics based on several different genres

## Description

Our goal for this project was to create new song lyrics based on four very different genres of music: rap, country, psychedelic rock, and musicals. We created four different text files of individual artists: NF, Morgan Wallen, The Beatles, and Phineas and Ferb. We based our code on an existing poetry generator (https://www.kaggle.com/code/paultimothymooney/poetry-generator-rnn-markov/notebook)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This program utilized the pronouncing Python library to generate rhyming words for the last word on each line of the lyrics.

[prounouncing]([https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/](https://pypi.org/project/pronouncing/))

* This program uses a Markov Chain to generate new lines of lyrics based on word probabilities

[Markov Chain]((https://pypi.org/project/pronouncing/)](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/))

* This program uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the properties of each new line of lyrics (rhyme scheme, number of syllables)

### Installing

* Download the code files into a Google CoLab notebook and push the play button at the top of each card.
