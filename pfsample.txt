Theme Song:
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
And school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it


Like maybe
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!)


Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)


Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)
As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do
Before school starts this fall (Come on, Perry!)


So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!


If Summer only lasted one day:
Well we'll wake up early and wax our surfboards down
(we'll hit the beach, yeah we'll hit the beach)
Throw our board shorts on and head for surfin' town
(we'll hit the beach, yeah we'll hit the beach, We'll ride the pipeline)
(later on the radio) If summer only lasted one day
(Summer only lasted one day)


Well we'll wake up early and wax our surfboards down
(we'll hit the beach, yeah we'll hit the beach)
Throw our board shorts on and head for surfin' town
(we'll hit the beach, yeah we'll hit the beach, We'll ride the pipeline)
We'll ride the pipeline
soak in the sunshine
and watch the dolphins play
If summer only lasted one day
(Summer only lasted one day)






Backyard Beach:
Listen up people and I'll teach ya
'Bout Phineas and Ferb
And the backyard beach yeah.


Every morning, Phineas, he gonna say


Say!
"Brother, whatcha gonna do today?"


Now you see we're having fun
Playin' under the sun,
And get in line, get in line.
'Cause the wet skis runnin'


A backyard beach, a backyard beach,
Nothing's outta reach,
we got the backyard beach.


You got skiin', parasailin',
Surfin' and a-flailin',
Your contacts need saline,
Or else you can't see.


Got the backyard beach, a backyard beach.
Nothing's out of reach, we got the backyard beach.
Got the backyard beach, a backyard beach,
Don't fall into the breach, got the backyard beach!


Hey! Hey! Backyard beach!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Don't fall into the breach, got the backyard beach!
Hey!


Perry the Platypus (short version):
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
Perry!


He's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action!
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
(Dooby dooby doo-bah)
He's a furry little flatfoot, who'll never flinch from a fray-ee-ay-ee-ay!
He's got more than just mad skill,
(Wah-ah-ah)
He's got a beaver tail and a bill,
(ah-ah)
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say:


He's Perry, Perry the Platypus!


But you can call him Agent P.
Perry!
I said you can call him Agent P.
A-gent-P!


Perry the Platypus (long version):


Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah (Yeah!)
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah (C'mon!)
Perry!


He's a semi-aquatic egg-layin' mammal of action
(Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah, doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah)
He's a furry little flatfoot who'll never flinch from a fra-ee-ay-ee-ay
He's got more than just mad skill
He's got a beaver tail and a bill
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say...
He's Perry, Perry the Platypus!
Perry, Perry the Platypus!


Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah


Well he's lookin' real sharp in his 1940s fedora
(Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah, doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah)
He's got an iron will, nerves of steel, and several other metal-themed attributes
His fur is watertight
And he's always up for a fight
So when evil hears this sound, it shakes in its boots


He's Perry! Perry the Platypus!
Perry! Perry the Platypus!


He's got more than just mad skill
He's got a beaver tail and a bill
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say...


He's Perry! (Perry!) Perry the Platypus!
Yeah, Perry! (Perry!) Perry the Platypus!
Talkin' 'bout Perry!
Agent P!

Though my vocabulary's incomplete! (guitar)

He’s a Bully:
Your opponent is as big as an ape,
So if you wanna avoid being mangled!
Just like him you've got to get into shape,
And by shape, I don't mean a triangle!


He's big; he's dumb, he's got the I.Q. of gum,
He's got the brain about the size of a sourdough crumb,
But he'll beat on your head like a big bass drum,
His behavior is truly unruly,


HE'S A BULLY! (he's a bully!)
Yeah, he's a bully! (he's a bully!)
Well, he's a bully! (he's a bully!)
Yeah, he's a bully! (he's a bully!)


(He's a bully) He's not easy to reason with,
(He's a bully) He's no rocket scientist,
(He's a bully) He's slow and illogical,
He's a bully!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah-yeah!


She’s Candace:
She's Candace
Like the Venus de Milo
Except she's not armless and handless
She's got a big honkin' truckload of ship-launching qualities
And this is the reason she bears no resemblance to a... praying mantis


Candace
A name with seven letters
Candace
Only wears designer sweaters


Candace
She's got an allergy to dairy
Candace
And she's anything but ordinary!


Phinedroids and Ferbots:
Ferbots: Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots


Phinedroids: We're Phinedroids and Ferbots
And we're stomping our feet
To the electric, magnetic, mechanical beat


We've got light bulbs for eyes
And aluminum noses
Ferbots: We're busting chillin' moves with our robot poses
(Busting chillin' moves with our robot poses)


Ferbots: Phinedroids and Ferbots

Ferbots: Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots
Phinedroids and Ferbots


Phinedroids: We're Phinedroids and Ferbots
And we're here to stay
Now our work is done,
We're shutting down for the day
But we've learned our lesson
We're switching to decaf lattes


(at this point, the lyrics cannot be understood because they fade out and are covered by Candace's and Linda's lines)


(when the volume comes back up on the song, it finishes with:)
Ferbot: ...our imagination.


Phinedroids: We're Phinedroids and Ferbots
And we're here to stay,
Now our work is done
we're shutting down for the day
But we've learned our lesson
We're switching to decaf lattes

We've got light bulbs for eyes

We're busting chillin' moves with our robot poses
(Busting chillin' moves with our robot poses)


My arm was a gutter, my right shin was a drain
The whole thing is controlled by ti-titanium brains
But without imagination, everything we create turns out lame
(Imagination, our imagination)


We're Phinedroids and Ferbots
And we're here to stay
Now our work is done
We're shutting down for the day
But we've learned our lesson
We're switching to decaf lattes

On the Trail:
On the trail
Always ridin' and a-ropin'
On the trail
Well, them doggies are a-lopin'
On the trail
(On the trail)


Nothin' worse than bees a-stingin'
'Cept this cowboy song we're singin'
On the trail
(On the trail)


The Sunset's looking awful groovy
On the trail

In the Mall:
In the mall
Up and down the escalaters
In the mall
I got a hankerin' for potaters
In the mall
In the mall
'Cause pretty soon now it'll
be about time to stop for vittles
In the mall


S’Winter:
Well, there's snow on the ground
There's sleigh bells all around
But the sun's beating down
'Cause it's... S'Winter (Ba dum).
It's ski and snowball fight-time
And also fly a kite-time
Cold and sunny, yes, that's right, I'm
Talkin' 'bout S'Winter.


It's a S'Winter S'Wonderland
Unusual and grand
You can freeze while you get tanned
Because it's S'Winter (Bum bum, bum bum)
Talkin' 'bout S'Winter (Bum bum, bum bum)
It's so S'Winter (Bum bum, bum bum)


EVIL Boys:
Those boys are always up to something
And it's bringing me to tears,
'Cause just before you get home
It always just magically disappears.


Those boys are evil.
But before you get home, they somehow always clean up the mess.
Vivian: Testify, Candace, testify!
Candace: Those boys are evil,
Let me spell it out for you, Mom.
E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S.


They built a roller coaster,
And a beach in the backyard.
Drove cattle through the city
And messed up the boulevard.
They took me back in time
When we went to that museum.
They built fifty foot tree-house robots,
But still you didn't see 'em.


Those boys are evil.
Their crazy shenanigans cause me all kinds of distress.
Those boys are evil.
Sing it with me,
E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S.


I know you think they're saints
But Mom, I'm here to tell
Those B-O-Y-S, they're just E-V-I-L.
Those boys are evil!
They're making me feel like my head's in a hydraulic press!
And that don't feel too good!


Those boys are evil!
Everybody!
E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!
That's what I'm talking about!
E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!
That's right those boys are...
Evil little boys!




Ba-da ba ba-da bah...


Let me tell you about my buddy,
He's 3,000 years old,
He's wrapped in bandages and covered in mold and debris
My undead mummy and me.
Mm-mm...


If a bully ever tries to poke me in the eye,
I'll introduce him to my decomposing guy,
And he'll flee,
From my undead mummy and me.


All the kids at school are gonna have a conniption,
When they get a load of my funky Egyptian MC...


My undead mummy and me,
Yeah...


Undead mummy and me!

You gotta bang your Betty bongos
And bring your Betty bass guitar
And with the Betty back beat
You'll go Betty, Betty far


So drop your boring baggage
And come with Missy, Tink, and Crash
There's a Betty (There's a Betty) bandwagon
Going to a Betty bash (Going to a Betty bash)!


Get ready for the Bettys, ready for the Bettys
Get ready for the Bettys, ready for the Bettys

Vanessa: I can see the things you're doin'
And you think that I'm naïve.
But when I get the goods on you
She'll finally believe.
Candace: Well she says it's all just drama.
But every bubble's got to pop.
She's gonna see just what you're doin'
Both: And then you're finally gonna have to stop!
Don't think you're gonna win this time,
'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime on you!
I'll get ya! (yeah)
I'll get ya!
And when I do, you're gonna be busted!
(Busted!)


I don't wanna put the hurt on you
But you better believe me


When I tell you that I finally got the dirt on you,
You're busted.
(Busted!)


Vanessa: Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light,
Both: This is how it's gonna be,
When she finds out that I was always right,
You're busted!


Both: There's a new cop on the beat,
And I'm bringing down the heat,
My eyes are wise to all your lies,
'Cause you're not that discreet.
And I don't care what you've heard,
'Cause there's one six letter word,
Vanessa: It's gonna set me free,
Candace: (Gonna set me free)
Vanessa: It starts with a «B»!
Candace: (Starts with a «B»!)
Both: It goes B-U-S-T-E-D!
You are busted!
(Busted!)


Both: I don't wanna put the hurt on you
But you better believe me,
When I tell you that I finally got the dirt on you,
(I'll get ya!)
You're busted.


(Don't think you're gonna win this time.)
Vanessa: Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light.
(Drop a dime on you.)
Both: This is how it's gonna be,
When she finds out that I was always right,
(I'll get ya! I'll get ya!)
You're busted!
