Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing, but you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green, but you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing, but you can't hear me
You can't hear me

When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

But if he loves you more, go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now

But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad

But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

She's sweeter than all the girls, and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me 'til the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby you're a rich man

Flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home

Honey, disconnect the phone

Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

The Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my mind

Oh, come on!
Woo! (Hey)
Woo! (Yeah)

And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my mind

Oh, show me 'round your snow-peaked mountains
Way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

I'm back In the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right
Just sitting down and looks so good

He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buys every Rock and Roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets, (oh), he's off to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher 'til at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a rolling, spinning in a hula-hoop

Well his rock and roll has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself, aw!

Aw!

Aw!

Gonna tell your mama, you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
You shoot the canary, and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat

Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself, whoa

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Tryin' to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know, they didn't even give us a chance

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honey mooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are goin'
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are goin'
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Givin' all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said, "Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul
Think"

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are goin'
They're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
50 acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are goin'
They're going to crucify me

The way things are goin'
They're going to crucify me

Ah, because the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round,
Ah Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high, ah Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue, ah, ah, ah, ah

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird, fly

Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird, fly

Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long

In case of accidents he always took his mum

Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill

'Kay

King of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out, now

She was a day tripper
One-way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now

She was a day tripper
A one-way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

I tried to please her
She only played one-night stands
I tried to please her
She only played one-night stands, now

Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But 'til she's here, please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone

I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a-ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a-moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late about an hour or two
I said that's all right, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

When I'm with her I'm happy

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Went out last night I didn't stay late
'fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round

And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round (oh oh oh)
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round

Oh ('round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
Oh

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I really love you

Da da da, da da dumb dumb da
Da da da, da da dumb dumb da
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do

Just call on me and I'll send it along

It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (no, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (no, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (ah-ah)
Turning me 'round (oh-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (fool, you fool)

I've got to admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (fool, you fool)

I admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about a girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl
Girl

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me, and I believe her
After all this time, I don't know why

Ah, girl
Girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh

Girl
Girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl
Girl

Ah, girl
Girl

I told you about Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well, here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he's living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Once there was a way
To get back homeward

Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise

Sleep, pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Good day sunshine

I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good day sunshine

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing

Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool

Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same

I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning, ah

People running round it's five o'clock

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't hide
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life

I've got to get you into my life

Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the pits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There
Running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want here everywhere
And if she beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Slave
Thou hast slain me
Villain, take my purse
If I ever
Bury my body
The letters which though find'st about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester
Seek him out upon the British Party
O untimely death
I know thee well
A serviceable villain, as duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire
What, is is he dead?
Sit you down, Father, rest you

I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name

I don't wanna spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

All through the day

All through the night

Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's reading it
Comin' on strong all the time

All through the day
I me mine

I me me mine, I me me mine

All I can hear

Flowing more freely than wine

Flowing more freely than wine

All through your life
I me mine

You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time, never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore

That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me

I need you
I need you
I need you

One, two, three, four!

Well, she was just seventeen, and you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Oh)
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woah)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went “boom” when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woah)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went “boom” when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Oh)
Since I saw her standing there

Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey
And I do

Whoa-oh-oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see? Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love, you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey, hey, hey
Give me more

Whoa-oh-oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see? Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

I wanna be your man
Oh, I wanna be your man
Come on, I wanna be your man
Now let me be your man

Oh, yeah, I'll tell you somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

Oh, please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
You'll let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feelin' that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feelin' that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you got that somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I feel that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusin' things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up, but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up, but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

I've got time
I've got time

I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me mad

I want you
I want you so bad, babe
I want you
I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me

I want you
I want you so bad, babe
I want you
I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me mad

I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me

She's so

Heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy

She's so

Heavy
She's so heavy (heavy, heavy, heavy)

I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me mad

I want you
You know I want you so bad, babe
I want you
You know I want you so bad
It's driving me mad, it's driving me mad
Yeah!

She's so-

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you...

If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah

You know if you break my heart, I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You, if you break my heart, I'll go
But I'll be back again

I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

One day you'll look
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know, oh

One day you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Yeah, tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know, oh

One day you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never blue

So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me
Oh, yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same old thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down, wow
Baby I'm down

Oh baby, you know I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh yes, I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down on the ground (I'm really down)
Ah, Down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm upside down, a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm feeling upside down (I'm really down)
Oh, I'm down (I'm really down)
Baby, I'm down, yeah
Oh baby, I'm down, yeah
Baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby, baby, baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down, down, down

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
